To control the MAX7219 display we will be using two awesome Arduino libraries.
1. MD_MAX72XX 2. MD_Parola
The MD_Parola library can be used to create many different text animations like scrolling and sprite text effects. 
This library depends on the MD_MAX72XX library which implements the hardware functions of the LED matrix.
