# Using 8*32 LED Dot-Matrix Display with Arduino

To control the MAX7219 display we will be using two awesome Arduino libraries.
MD_MAX72XX  MD_Parola
<p>The MD_Parola library can be used to create many different text animations like scrolling and sprite text effects. This library depends on the MD_MAX72XX library which implements the hardware functions of the LED matrix.
